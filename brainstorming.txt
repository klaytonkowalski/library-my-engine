Things That Frustrate Me About Other Engines and Frameworks:

* Modern GLSL features are not supported.
* Multiplayer is so freaking difficult and shrouded in mystery.
* Symbol conflicts with external libraries.
* Confusing or overly-abbreviated APIs.
* Focus mainly on 2D or 3D, but not both.
* Primitive shapes and other basic assets are not included by default.
* Lighting is not prioritized as a core feature.
* Functionally separating the game world from the GUI.
* Supporting every platform under the sun for the sake of being "cross-platform."
* Broken build systems that cause existential crises, especially to beginners.
* Lack of function documentation or erroneous documentation.
* Lack of example applications or example shaders.
* Forcing developers to reinvent the wheel, such as lighting, time-tested mechanics, and persistence.
* Poor readability of source code.
* Lack of support for a scripting language, forcing recompiles for every edit.
* Advanced features require a lot of background knowledge, suck as efficient collisions, lighting, and post-processing effects.
* Trying to be everything to everyone, or over-engineering at the expensive of simpler games.

Kinds of Game That One Could Imagine Developing:

* Pok√©mon Emerald
* Super Mario World
* VVVVVV
* Stardew Valley
* Minecraft
* Doom 1993

(Verdict: Classics that do not require state-of-the-art technologies or extensive background knowledge.)

Critical Features:

* Simple, consistent, and verbose API.
* Modules that implement configurable time-tested mechanics.
* Comprehensive documentation and examples for functions, common features, shaders, etc.
* Invisible build system.
* Ease of multiplayer.
* Support for both 2D and 3D.
* Primitive shapes for rapid prototyping.
* Ease of lighting.
* Lua scripting.

Things I Want Nothing to Do With:

* Support for every platform on Earth.
* State-of-the-art anything.
* Engine bloat.
* Unreliable, confusing, or bloated third-party libraries.
* Infinite engine development without building actual games.
* File hierarchies deeper than Hell.
